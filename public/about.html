<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I'm a passionate web developer with a knack for creating clean, functional, and user-friendly websites. With a strong foundation in 
  <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and modern frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, I love turning ideas into fully functional digital experiences.
</p>

<p>
  Over the past few years, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from simple landing pages to dynamic web applications. My expertise lies in 
  <strong>front-end development</strong>, but I'm no stranger to backend technologies like <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>. I'm always excited to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest web trends.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design inspirations, solving programming challenges, or helping fellow developers in online communities. I believe in collaboration, clean code, and delivering exceptional results.
</p>

<p>
  Let's connect and create something amazing together!
